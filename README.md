# Android SDK Custom

**Android SDK Custom** is a custom-built Android SDK that replaces the default binaries with rebuilt ones.

It integrates alternative libc implementations like **musl** (via **[Zig](https://ziglang.org/)**), **Bionic** (from the official Android NDK), **[llvm-mingw](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw)** and the macOS SDK (via **[osxcross](https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross)**) to provide a more flexible and portable build environment.

This project is inspired by [lzhiyong's Android SDK Tools](https://github.com/lzhiyong/android-sdk-tools).
